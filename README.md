# HorseRacing
A backend project i did for school, requires mysql, check below for instructions on how to run


download the latest release and create a database named horse_racing, then run horse_racing.sql in horse_racing using phpmyadmin.
Your database should now be setup. Let's setup the website to actually run it in
run serve.py to start a local web server and run the following command using powershell in the same folder as serve.py
```
python serve.py --root .
```
You now created a local web server, simply go to localhost in your web browser and the game should run normally!!!
